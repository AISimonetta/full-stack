✦ Full Stack Project ✦

This was the final project during my _nology Full Stack training program. I created a website where you can browse for bread recipes to bake at home. The goal was to solidify all the knowledge acquired during our training and integrate back-end development with the front end.

This project includes:

  • Data stored in a database with two tables. 
  • An API and back end developed using Spring Boot & Java.
  • Front-end development.

In this project, you can:

 • View bread recipes.

 • Filter the list of bread recipes.

 • Create new bread recipes.

✦ Technologies Used:

| React | SCSS | BEM Methodology | TypeScript | Java | Spring Boot | MySQL

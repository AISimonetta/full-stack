  "recipe_description": "Step 1: Make the dough\nIn a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water. Add salt, sugar and 2 cups of flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.\n\nStep 2: Knead the dough\nTurn the dough onto a floured surface. Knead it for six to eight minutes until it’s smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about an hour.\n\nStep 3: Form the loaves\nUncover the dough and punch it down. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and divide it in half. Shape the dough into two 12-inch long loaves.\n\nStep 4: Let it rise\nPlace the dough seam side down on a greased baking sheet. Cover and let it rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.\n\nStep 5: Prep the loaves\nPreheat the oven to 450°F. Sprinkle the loaves with cornmeal. With a sharp knife or baker’s lame, make four shallow slashes across the top of each loaf.\n\nStep 6: Bake the bread\nBake for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. Brush the loaves with melted butter if you’d like.",
